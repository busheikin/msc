          p Cannabis varieties grow in many places around the world making for a diverse genetic heritage.  Further, the ability to produce Cannabis hybrids allows for the combining of useful traits. This genetic diversity can therefore be used to produce new varieties with useful combinations of productivity and the levels of useful chemical constituents important for both recreational as well as medical use.

          p We will continue to develop new genetic varieties with improved characteristics. This will be done with scientific rigour including the use of genomic sequences of the different varieties to inform the genetic program. In addition, the phenotype of the resulting lines will not only be tested for productivity traits but also for the presence of the fullest range of chemical constituents like cannabinoids and terpenes using modern analytical techniques.

          h3 Genetic Research
          p We not only have world-class expertise in genetics, but also in the use of genome sequence information to inform genetic selection, in analytical analysis of cannabinoids and terpenes as well as other important chemical constituents as well as in plant physiology. This expertise will be used in a continuing genetic program to develop new and improved Cannabis varieties.

          h3 Custom Cannabis Genetics Program
          p We will work with clients to develop custom genetic lines that will be unique. We will bring to bear all of our expertise for this purpose including the use of genome sequence information and analytical tools. In particular if you have particular profiles of chemical constituents you wish to develop in your lines, we will use these combined types of expertise to help you identify new varieties matching your needs.
