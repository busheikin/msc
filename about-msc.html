                                <p style="margin-bottom:0">Dr. Akhtar completed his doctorate under the mentorship of Dr. Andrew Hanson at the University of Florida where he contributed to a viable and cost-effective way to overcome global folate malnutrition through plant 'bio fortification'. His research specifically addressed the issue of folate breakdown and storage and demonstrated a central role for polyglutamylation in the homeostasis of this plant-derived vitamin.</p>

                                  <p>Dr. Akhtar followed his interest in plant biochemistry to the laboratory of Dr. Eran Pichersky at the University of Michigan where he focused on two main projects. The first, a stable isotope-assisted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platform to discover a novel breakdown and recycling pathway for the plant hormone, salicylic acid. The second project built on his recently published work describing the plant enzymes that synthesize polyisoprenoids and dolichols. Dr. Akhtar utilized a genomics approach to identify a novel class of cis-prenyltransferases that appear to be widespread among different plant lineages.  He recently joined the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department at Guelph and his research continues to investigate the biochemical pathways that operate at the interface of plant primary and secondary metabolism.</p>
